***But when people hear the word concurrency they often think of parallelism, a related but quite distinct concept.***   
***In programming, concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.***   
***Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.***   
***Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.***
